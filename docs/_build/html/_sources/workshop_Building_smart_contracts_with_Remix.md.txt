Building Smart Contracts with Remix
=======================

We prepared a tutorial that will help you build DApps with Remix. In this tutorial, you learn how to build smart contracts, how to deploy them and how to interact with them. Then we show you how to connect your frontend with the blockchain by using web3.js.

### Let's get started

These tutorials were used in workshops at ethCC, Edcon, and DappCon. They are using the old interface.  We will be updating these slides in the near future.

You can [watch the Edcon presentation talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAI_Cr5Y8JY) and here are the [workshop slides](https://slides.com/ninabreznik/deck-11-13#/).
