Code contribution guide
=======================

Remix is an open source tool and we encourage anyone to help us improve our tool.
You can do that by opening issues, giving feedback or by contributing a pull request
to our codebase.

The Remix application is built with JavaScript and it doesn't use any framework. We only
rely on selected set of npm modules, like `yo-yo`, `csjs-inject` and others. Check out the `package.json` files in the Remix submodules to learn more about the stack.
