# Release Management

Release managers are responsible for the release management lifecycle, focusing on coordinating various aspects of production and projects into one integrated solution. They are responsible for ensuring that resources, timelines, and the overall quality of the process are all considered and accounted for. 

# Steps of Release Management

## Release planning: 
In this stage, release manager will elaborate a plan for the coming release. 
Together with the team, the release manager will form a list of issues and PRs that should be addressed during the release.
More generally and a non negligeable part of the planning is to properly ensure that bugs, issues that weren't totally identified in the roadmap, and the roadmap issues are still being processed as they should.

## Configuring releases: 
Release managers will oversee the various aspects of a project before it is due to be deployed, ensuring everyone is on track and meeting the agreed timeline.

## Quality Checks:
The quality of the release needs to be reviewed before a project is officially launched.
The release manager is in charge of ensuring manual testing is properly planned and done.
Also that unit testing and e2e for new feaures have been included.

## Deployment: 
After being quality checked, the project is ready to be deployed. 
The release manager is still responsible for ensuring a project is rolled out smoothly and efficiently.
