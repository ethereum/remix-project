**Remix libraries** are part of the Remix Project and provide tools that help smart contract development, compilation, testing & deployment. These tools also work as a core of native plugins of **Remix IDE**.

**Remix IDE** is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum. 

The Remix IDE repository is specifically available **[here](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/tree/master/apps/remix-ide)**, and an online version is available at https://remix.ethereum.org.

To start with Remix IDE, check out [official documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Here is the brief description of Remix libraries.

+ [`remix-analyzer`](remix-analyzer/README.md): Perform static analysis on Solidity smart contracts to check security vulnerabilities and bad development practices
+ [`remix-astwalker`](remix-tests/README.md): Parse solidity AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
+ [`remix-debug`](remix-debug/README.md): Debug Ethereum transactions. It provides several controls that allow stepping over the trace and seeing the current state of a selected step.
+ [`remix-simulator`](remix-simulator/README.md): Web3 wrapper for different kind of providers
+ [`remix-solidity`](remix-solidity/README.md): Load a Solidity compiler from provided URL and compile the contract using loaded compiler and return the compilation details
+ [`remix-lib`](remix-lib/README.md): Common place for libraries being used across multiple modules
+ [`remix-tests`](remix-tests/README.md): Unit test Solidity smart contracts. It works as a plugin & as CLI both
+ [`remix-url-resolver`](remix-url-resolver/README.md): Provide helpers for resolving the content from external URL ( including github, swarm, ipfs etc.).
+ [`remix-ws-templates`](remix-ws-templates/README.md): To create a workspace using different templates on Remix IDE
+ [`remixd`](remixd/README.md): Allow accessing local filesystem from Remix IDE by running a daemon

Each library is an NPM package and has basic documentation about its usage in its own `README`.
